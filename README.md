Trump’s Actions Have Created a Constitutional Crisis, Scholars Say  
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-constitutional-crisis.html | https://archive.md/pz0qJ  
> The distinctive feature of the current situation, several legal scholars said, is its chaotic flood of activity that collectively amounts to a radically new conception of presidential power.   
[...]  
> “The administration’s early moves,” she added, “also seem designed to demonstrate maximum contempt for core constitutional values — the separation of powers, the freedom of speech, equal justice under law.”  
[...]  
> “It’s a constitutional crisis when the president of the United States doesn’t care what the Constitution says regardless whether Congress or the courts resist a particular unconstitutional action,” she said. “Up until now, while presidents might engage in particular acts that were unconstitutional, I never had the sense that there was a president for whom the Constitution was essentially meaningless.”

In recent years, the National Science Foundation has received an annual budget of approximately $9 billion, the vast majority of which is spent on research and research-related activities. The cuts could be as deep as 66 percent, with one person indicating the top-line budget number for the National Science Foundation could start at $3 billion.  
> Such a massive cut is not out of line with a proposal made by Russ Vought for the fiscal year 2023 budget as part of his Center for Renewing America. Vought is expected to become the White House budget director in the coming days. Three years ago, Vought proposed cutting the National Science Foundation budget to $3.9 billion.

Journal: https://publichealth.realclearjournals.org

Through pre-submission gatekeeping at the author level rather than for each article, and by assuming that all our members have valuable scientific contributions that are worthy of publication, the research can be published more rapidly, without potentially having to submit it to multiple journals. Great research should be published as soon as possible to promptly advance science. Flawed research is better published together with critical reviews from the first journal to which it is submitted. Now such papers waste precious time by requiring multiple reviews and rejections by different journals, while most are still eventually published with a stamp of approval from a “peer-reviewed journal,” but without readers having access to those earlier critical reviews.
